# BeerBank

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.1.4.

The project was made with Angular Material as the look of the example looked like it could be 
done with it, I have a lot more experience using Bootstrap and Ng-Bootrap than with Angular
Material so there are many thing that could be improved.
Some improvements were not implemented due to the deadline, between them is a refactor of
the grid into one reusable component, general css improvements and some minor refactors.



## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests (not implemented)

Sadly I couldn't implement the unit tests in the time given, so they wont be really useful here
Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests (not implemented)

Sadly I couldn't implement the tests in the time given, so they wont be really useful here
Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
